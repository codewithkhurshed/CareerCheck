# Career Check - App
## Problem Statement: 
As Bangladesh is a populous country. It is plagued with many 
problems. A large portion of its population is unemployed or not even self employed. Also, many young graduates have no job. They are unable to turn
themselves into self-employed to support their families. Adding about one million 
new graduates every year to our existing unemployed population is further 
complicating the situation. The Bangladesh Institute of development studies made 
the observations over a survey and has revealed alarming information. As of 2017, 
about 66 percent of graduates remain unemployed, including those who have 
completed honors courses and postgraduates from 2154 public and private colleges 
affiliated with the national university (NU). [1] There are some factors of not getting 
job in job market. Recruiters often fail to find proper candidate for their role. 
Students tend to lack industry level practical knowledge. Students lack a proper 
career guidance. To solve this issue, we have proposed a solution. An app where 
students can seek career guidance from founders, CEOs, entrepreneurs of related 
field. Student can attend mock interviews which will help themselves to know about 
the level of their skill are enough to get a fresher job or not.
## Effect on Society: 
In recent times, university degree holders do not meet the demand 
of the job market. The situation is such that when hiring, employees have to be 
trained from the beginning. Business entrepreneurs are not getting skilled people 
from our country for management positions. [1] The survey was conducted with a 
view to finding out how much of the graduates from the National University are 
contributing to the national workforce. However, 97% of students who graduated 
from the National University complained that they did not receive any assistance 
from teachers or educational institutions when looking for a job after graduation. [2]
As a result, huge numbers of private sector manpower are being recruited from India, 
Sri Lanka, and other countries for management positions. A large part of our foreign 
exchange is being spent behind them. Statistics show that each 3 to 5 billion dollars 
is spent on foreign manpower. It would have been better if these students had been 
given the opportunity to pursue vocational and technical education, equivalent to 
building a suitable career in various industries and services. [1]

## Our Proposed Solution:

Career Check is an app where students can seek career guidance from founders, 
CEOs, entrepreneurs of related field. Student can attend mock interviews which will 
help themselves to know about the level of their skill are enough to get a fresher job 
or not. Here is our proposed solution:

### Fig: 1.0. Our Proposed Solution Diagram

There are two panels student and Tech leader. Student will sign up and login from 
app. Students can add personal informationâ€™s like name, date of birth, NID 
verification, phone, email and address. Students can add their educational 
background information, projects, skills and previous work experience information.
